This folder had the RW3D model simulating the tracer test (Br) of the Schoolcraft site.

The model only has one species, Bromide. 

The exectuable files used for the simulation is RW3D_Sep_29.exe. It runs model continuously with random numbers generated through clock function.

The regular rw3d model is RW3D_Oct_01.exe, as described in C:\Users\Dong\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\RW3D_readme.txt.

The tracer test is calibrated in order to have a good base for the reactive simulation. The calibrations are in folder: 
E:\Research_2016\Work on RW3D\Work\Bromide_SC.

The porosity of 0.3 is found to be better fit than 0.35. The screen interval for monitor wells is from 0.5 to 0.7 m. The normalizing ratio is described in "Br Normalizing the number of particles to concentration.docx".


The model results are plotted in the folder: E:\Research_2016\Field Scale - PT\RW3D model\Br_plots. The calibration results are plotted in E:\Research_2016\Field Scale - PT\Schoolcraft site\Work\Br_100116.

plot_bromide_obs_smooth.m plots the smoothed curved for making the figures.
