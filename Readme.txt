This folder includes the files for the paper with title: Elimination of the reaction rate “scale effect”: Application of the Lagrangian reactive particle-tracking method to simulate mixing-limited, field-scale biodegradation at the Schoolcraft (MI, USA) site.

It includes the following subfolders:

I. Codes
	1. RW3D codes
		1) for column experiment
		2) for field scale tracer test (bromide)

	2. RT3D codes
		1) Original code from Dr. Phanikumar
		2) Code using the parameters values report in Phanikumar et al. (2005)
		3) Rt3D code without the acetate correction term in the equation for comparison.
